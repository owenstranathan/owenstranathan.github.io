## About me

*Yell at computers.  
Sometimes they listen. Such peace.  
Mostly they don't. Sad.*

I work as a computer wrangler (dev-ops engineer) at [appfigures](https://appfigures.com). 

Appfigures is really great, you should check us out.

I graduated in 2016 from the University of Akron in Akron, OH with a B.S. in Computer Science

Fun fact:  
I spent most of my pre programming days as a cook at restaurants (haute-cuisine and greasy spoons alike)

In university I got really interested in Compiler and Language design, I still think that stuff  
is cool and I'm always down to talk about it.

As a programmer at appfigures I spend a lot of time messing around with kubernetes,   
pretending to know what I'm doing writing python (python is the best), and suffering from bash [Stockholm syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome)

## Work

#### Bender

One of the first projects I worked on at appfigures was a CI/CD bot which I lovingly named "Bender", after my favorite cartoon robot. Bender listens on an endpoint for a webhook from our CI platform and posts to a slack channel when a build succeeds to allow engineers at appfigures to "bless" a build before deploying them to a kubernetes cluster.

#### iOS SDKs

Since completing work on our CI/CD pipeline I've spent most of my time
focusing on our iOS sdk analysis tools. I can't really give the details, just 
know that I have a healthy level of hate for Apple as a result.


## What I like to do when I don't have to be doing anything

I don't like to have a lot of free time.

In my free time I do in no specific order:

* Cycling
* Cooking
* Writing
* Woodworking
* Reading (Technical, News, Literature, Fiction)
* More Programming
* Sewing
* Designing (SketchUp, Affinity Designer)
* Game Design (Unity)
* Play video games (I started a Game Club - like a book club but with video games - with some co-workers and we make a [podcast](https://soundcloud.com/hard-af-games))

## What Iâ€™m looking to do next

Make games and contribute to OSS I use and like (like [pipenv](pipenv.org)).
