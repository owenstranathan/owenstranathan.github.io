# Mission

To live honestly and fully. And to create something truly beautiful.

## My self-summary

I am a young programmer and creative. I am passionate about elegance in design and making things that not only work but work beautifully. I derive pleasure from organizing thoughts and principles into cohesive systems and abstractions. I have spent a lot of time traveling the world and studying literature and philosophy. I have a deep appreciation for art, not simply what you might preconceive art to be(viz. painting, sculpture, music, etc.), but rather the art within all things. I believe that everything that is created, if it is done honestly and if it comes from a place of passion within a person's soul, is truly art. As such, things like software can be art, the experiences can be art, even businesses can be works of art. I want to work in my capacity as a programmer in a field that is important to me. Such fields include but are not limited to:

* Conservation
* Clean/Renewable Energy
* Sustainable Housing
* Game Design, Film Making and other Story telling medias
* Journalism and Writing

## What I’ve worked on

I am recently graduated, and have taken a gap year for traveling. As such my relevant work experience is limited. However I have nearly always had a job since I was 16 and am not shy of hard work.

In university I spent time working on a compiler with a professor, which was an enlightening experience in large open source software development. Here is a [link](https://github.com/owenstranathan/banjo) to my fork of the repository we worked on. (I've lost touch with the professor but from what I understand he has since stopped work on the project in favor of other projects)

In school I did a lot of projects but the only one I really enjoyed enough and feel proud enough of to show is a Video Game Database similar to iMDB but for video games called GameBean. I don't have it hosted and I haven't looked at it in a while, but here is [a link to it's GitHub repository](https://github.com/owenstranathan/GameBean) it's written in Python using Django.

In my last job as a software developer I worked on a project that I no longer have access
to the source code of, and the details of which I am not at liberty to discuss. On that project, I wrote
up a repository pattern for the database facing data access layer of the web app service in C#/.NET which I
generalized and saved. [Here](https://github.com/owenstranathan/Noodles/tree/master/EFRepositoryPattern) is a link to that bit of code.


## I’m really good at

* Organizing messes.
* Abstraction
* Writing and otherwise textually organizing my thoughts
* Communicating (except with my wife) <- that's just a joke
* Intuitively grasping complex ideas and concepts.
* Piano
* Cooking
* Traveling lightly (Everything I own fits in a 44 liter backpack, [this one](https://www.rei.com/product/895780/kelty-redwing-44-pack), but mine's black.

## What I’m looking to do next

Work on something new and exciting and bigger than I can possibly imagine.
