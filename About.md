# Mission

To live honestly and fully. And to create something truly beautiful.

## My self-summary

I am a young programmer and creative. I am passionate about elegance in design and making things that not only work but work beautifully. I derive pleasure from organizing thoughts and principles into cohesive systems and abstractions. I have spent a lot of time traveling the world and studying literature and philosophy. And I have found that the thing I truly enjoy is learning and creating, building things that
have a use to me and to those around me. In fact I spend all my time working on software projects, because
programming is my craft and a craftsman must needs create.

## What I’ve worked on

In university I spent time working on a compiler with a professor, which was an enlightening experience in large open source software development. Here is a [link](https://github.com/owenstranathan/banjo) to my fork of the repository we worked on. (I've lost touch with the professor but from what I understand he has since stopped work on the project in favor of other projects)

In school I did a lot of projects but the only one I really enjoyed enough and feel proud enough of to show is a Video Game Database similar to iMDB but for video games called GameBean. I don't have it hosted and I haven't looked at it in a while, but here is [a link to it's GitHub repository](https://github.com/owenstranathan/GameBean) it's written in Python using Django.

In my last job as a software developer I worked on a project that I no longer have access
to the source code of, and the details of which I am not at liberty to discuss. On that project, I wrote
up a repository pattern for the database facing data access layer of the web app service in C#/.NET which I
generalized and saved. [Here](https://github.com/owenstranathan/Noodles/tree/master/EFRepositoryPattern) is a link to that bit of code.

Most recently I've built a **very basic** android app for playing music. I emphasize
basic because it is, by design, very basic. I made this app because I didn't feel there
were any good options for a media player on the app store. Every media player out there
tries to do too much and ends up doing a bunch of things poorly. My needs are simple, I need
a media player that enables me to riffle through my SD card's file system and find my music
exactly where I put it. Most apps don't do this, they use android's "recommended" practice
of using content resolvers to access a model of the audio/visual files on the system and then
present them categorized by various meta data classifiers. That's fine and works well in
many instances, however much of my music does not have reliable meta data attached to it (for
various reasons, most notably that most of it is "pirated"). And so I must either find a way to
edit the meta data for each file of my 24 GB worth of music, or make a media player with a
file-explorer style UI that gives me access to the tree-like file structure I already
have my files arranged in. I opted for the second one although the search-ability proffered by
the use of meta-data as a means of building a tag-based file system is almost enough of a boon,
that I'm seriously considering extending the app to offer the ability to edit file meta-data
and then switch back and forth between a tagging/meta-data based UI and the current file system UI.
In any case the app is basic and it works for my needs, and it taught me a lot about Android which is
pretty easy to be honest, the only challenges are the same challenges facing any UI programming,
that is the use of threading to avoid UI blocking - but let's be honest that isn't that hard.
I'm considering doing a re-write because everything is always cleaner if you re-write it and I
have no plans to put it on google play (I might put a build of it on my website for download).
The code it open source and can be forked and cloned and hacked and improved by going [here](https://github.com/owenstranathan/NobleShitMusic).

## I’m really good at

* Learning new things quickly in order to accomplish a greater goal.
* Organizing messes.
* Abstraction
* Writing and otherwise textually organizing my thoughts
* Communicating (except with my wife) <- that's just a joke
* Intuitively grasping complex ideas and concepts.
* Piano
* Cooking
* Traveling lightly (Everything I own fits in a 44 liter backpack, [this one](https://www.rei.com/product/895780/kelty-redwing-44-pack), but mine's black.

## What I’m looking to do next

Work on something new and exciting, but mostly I would like to get some solid new experiences
working at a software company as part of a team. I'd very much like to settle down for a while
and focus on building my skills as a software craftsman <- totally cool new term I just coined ;)
