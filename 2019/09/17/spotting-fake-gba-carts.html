                    <p>A few months back I bought an <a href="">Advanced Wars</a> cartridge for my wicked sweet modded GameBoy Advanced on ebay,
but when I got it turned out to be a fake!
I was really ticked about it, so I made some PSA graphics to post in imgur and reddit.</p>
<p>I'm putting them up here as well, because I can and I want to.</p>

<div class="disclaimer">
    <p>
        My blog exists as a place for me to (as frictionlessly as possible) write often and without concern for the
        reception. Like a public journal with more drawn out and philosophical entries and topics. That said I don't always have
        the time or inclination to proof read each post as thoroughly as I might if I were publishing my writing on paper.
        Without doubt I will have made some spelling and grammar mistakes. I maybe even said one or two things that just plain
        don't make sense. I hope you'll understand and not judge to harshly. It's true that good writing is good editing,
        however my aim in this blog is quantity and consistency and not quality. Any good writing found here is entirely
        incidental and should be excused.
