        <p>Sorry but there's a problem and that page you want ain't where it's supposed to be.
        <br>Come back later and maybe the turkey that runs this place will
        have sorted it out.</p>
        <p>In the mean time, I hope you've had a nice day and would like to give you
            this bowl of noodles.
            It's not a real bowl of noodles but it's all I've got.</p>
