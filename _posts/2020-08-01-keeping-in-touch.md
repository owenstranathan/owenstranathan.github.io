I have a hard time keeping in touch. I know why, but I don't understand.

I have lived in a lot of places, and for what feels like forever I've kind of been living
an iternarant lifestyle. In the last (let's call it) 5 years, the longest I've stayed in one place is 21 months, (that was NYC and
of all the other places I went, is far and away the longest) and have moved 12 times. I have met a lot of people
in those 12 moves and 5 years, and I've not kept in touch.

Usually when I leave a place it's a totally selfish choice. Either I just can't resist the excitement of leaving, or I just can't stand
the boredom of staying. When I leave usually I'm so focused on escape I don't even think about what I'm leaving behind, I just keep my eye set
straight in front, on the next (mis)adventure. And this kind of makes me a piece of shit. But I don't mean to be.

Today I wrote 3 emails to people I've not spoken to in a while. Of the 3, 2 were because I needed something from these people. That really makes me a
piece of shit. In fact I only wrote third because the first 2 made me realize just how bad at staying in touch I am. Piece of shit.

I want to have life long friends that I keep in close touch with. I want to call my buddy and just ask how they're doing (and actually care)
but I don't (call or care). Of course when I stop and think about it I do care, and I do call, and I try to be a good friend and have good friends.
The problem is that most of the time I don't think about it. I'm not sure how to be better. At least I know I should be, and that's a start I guess.


I think I'll go write a fourth email now. I know just who to send it to.
