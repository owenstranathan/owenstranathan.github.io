# Work

We all have to work. Some of us don't like it. Some of us have learned to love it.
And the rest of us are just kind of listlessly getting by without an opinion.
As a child one regards work as this nebulous activity executed by one's parents
on a ritualistically regular basis. One has no negative emotions toward the idea
of work unless one comes to have an experience that enforces a negative association
with work.

Such experiences could be something like:

* One's father missing an important game/recital/activity of any kind on account of "work"
* One's parents complaining that they are constantly doing "all the work".
* One being compelled to perform an unenjoyable chore or activity, for the benefit of another and that being referred to as "work".

In most instances, a given person, over the course of their development will come
to regard this thing we call "work" as something that *they*,
given the choice, most certainly don't want to do.

Like most accidents of development and societal evolution, this is really stupid and
really bad.

# Ego

Let's take a moment and go back to our own minds before they were unintentionally shaped
into what they are today. Really think now, become the person you were before you
had to have a name for everything that popped into your head.

Do you remember? It's alright if you don't, it's really difficult to remember.

If you do you probably remember that you didn't do a damn thing you didn't want to,
and when something you didn't want or intend happened, that is to say, when something unexpected
happened as unexpected things are want to do, you did not have an immediate reaction
to them. You didn't have a quick categorization for this new experience to slip into
and be tucked away as a "good", "bad", "so-so", etc. experience. Some would have you believe
that at this moment you didn't have a "clear" picture of the world around you. They
would have you believe that you were ignorant or that you weren't yet capable of comprehending
things beyond a certain level. This is true to a certain extent. You probably weren't
capable of doing complex mathematics, or constructing particularly complicated thoughts,
and sentences, but just because you were inexperienced, and unpracticed doesn't mean
to say that you lacked the potential to do such things.

What I'm driving at is that a child while naive and inexperienced is equally intelligent,
insightful, and emotionally capable as his mature counter part who comes to
exist several years later. A child is not only just as intelligent but more capable in some
respects in that a child can intuitively and without struggle accept each thing, just as it
exists, without frustration and without trying to change it or morph it to fit some expectation.
This is because the child has no expectation to begin with.

What a child is worse at, much worse at, is peacefully co-existing in a society of people.
And so in an effort to make day to day interaction with others more amicable and less violent.
A child learns to except certain classifications, they learn to name things and they achieve speech.
They learn to categorize things and they develop expectations. And they learn to like and dislike things
and they learn to want. Once they've learned all these things they can integrate perfectly with society,
and they are suddenly very frustrated by all these things they've learned and how poorly the universe
actually conforms to their names, expectations and wants.

In essence they've developed their ego. And they've draw their line in the sand, separating love from hate, and separating themselves and everything from the universe. They've isolated themselves and they feel unhappy.

# Work

Where does work fit into this? Well work is something we hate, and work is very special in that,
the best sort of work, the work that is really worth doing, requires complete and totally concentration.
Work that's really worth it, forces one to dedicate their consciousness completely, their entire brain must strive to the satisfaction of the work, and through the work the part of you that formed in an effort to "fit in" is silenced, that part too is focused on the work. You become one consciousness singly focused, and the universe and all the lines you've draw on it to divide and sub-divide it melt away and like a child once more you accept each thing just as it is, and you're free and pure.
