# Story time

When I was a teenager I was given to lying about most everything I did.
These were not malicious lies, intended to gain something not deserved or to
trick a person into believing a falsehood. But rather they were lies of
self preservation. You see I was inclined to enjoy the sinful pleasures of life
at a young age (my first cigarette and my first beer, both spirited from my
childhood best friend's parents, came at the same time at the age of 12. And
my first joint came not long after). I don't know what drew me so greatly to such vises.
Perhaps it was that they were forbidden that made their dangerous enjoyment all the more
sweet, but in any case I began my experimentation with them much younger than many of
my peers, and I believe as a consequence lost my interest much younger as well.

As a result of such indulgences I formed a habit of never quite telling the truth
about what I was doing. I would often times create highly complex stories about
where I had been and who I was with. After a time my skill grew and I was able to
incorporate details referencing information of public knowledge into these myths
to lend them credibility. I believe that it was during this time period,
when I was so scared of being found out for what I was that I formed my habit of
eavesdropping incessantly, after all a well informed lier is a better lier
(because knowledge is power).

Often times when I hadn't enough time to craft a
worthy lie and I was questioned about my suspicious comings and goings, I would
simply tell the perfect truth with the slight
addition of something so ludicrous, so outlandishly improbable, so obviously not
true that all suspicion would immediately be cast off and I would be safe to
lie another day.

This went on for a long while until, when I was 19, I had out my wisdom teeth. I
remember it well because the drugs they gave me to knock me out were the best ones
I've ever had before or since. My mother took me to the doctor and drove me home from the procedure.
I have no memory of my actually confessing, but it apparently happened because the next day
my mother had intimate knowledge of nearly every thing I had done in recent memory
that I would have been loath to honestly admit to.

This caused some trouble for me but it quickly subsided and my family, although
disappointed in my lack of moral fiber still loved me and I was none the worse off
for my accidental honesty. And it was this fact that lead me to realize that I
had been doing myself a disservice by lying and hiding and sneaking for so long.
I had caused myself such undo stress and headache crafting lies and remembering them,
being infinitely careful not to let them cross or become tangled when they had to.
It would have been much simpler and life would have been much less stressful, had
I simply told always the truth, and expended the saved energy from lying on overcoming
the probable consequences of my misguided actions. And so I made a pact with myself
to live honestly from then on, to always say when asked, just what I think and feel
and to live with the consequences of doing such. I felt good about this and it came
easily at first.

# The difficulties of an honest life

But to live honestly becomes extremely difficult at times, honorable as it may be,
it often times leads to disastrous consequences. And the old tempter, dishonesty
comes creeping back, ready and waiting to ease the situation into a
clever and convenient fantasy. I haven't always kept my word with myself. And god knows
that I've broken my pact to live honestly on more than one occasion.
It's not always simple to tell the truth, and often times emotional conflicts arise
when telling the truth to a loved one. But I still believe that it is vitally important
to always remain honest, if not with every person, than at least with those people whom
you love and elect to spend most of your time with. And above all it is most important
to be honest with yourself. That sound very cliche, and that's because it has become a
cliche. Most oft-repeated sayings find their way into the realm of cliche by being
true and applicable to everyone. So to sound less cliche, and to give you an illustration
of exactly what I mean when I tell you to be honest with yourself I'll turn your attention
to a superficial analysis of lying, and the underlying motivations for doing so.

## Why do we lie?

Think of a situation where you are inclined to lie.

Is it to hide something?
Is it to trick a person?

What is the impetus for wanting to do any of these things? Are you afraid of
what might happen if your secret that you're trying to hide gets out?
Do you have something to gain from tricking some one?

I believe that most causes for lying can be boiled down to two reasons, that are
really just one reason if you think about it.
They are:

   * Fear of the truth becoming known.
   * Desire for a falsehood to be believed.

Extenuating circumstances aside, these two things are the primary reasons that lies
seem to occur. But these are really just one reason, the first one in fact.

Desire for a falsehood to be believed is the same as Fear of the truth becoming known
when you consider what they mean individually.

For example:

>Would a person who is afraid of the truth coming out, not also desire a falsehood
to be believed?(in place of the truth) They would, and so fearing the revelation
of truth is the same as desire for untruth to go unquestioned.

>And would a person who desires a falsity to be considered truth, not also fear the
revelation of truth? They would.

So you see the fear of truth and the love of(or desire for) falsity are logically
equivalent, and when you word it as I just have, it intuitively makes sense.

So it is sufficient to say that lies occur because one fears the truth.

Now what was I getting at?

...

Oh yes, honesty with one's self.

So if then one lies for fear of the truth, then lying to oneself is in essence a
cowardly act.

One fears what might happen should one confront themselves with what is true. And
so it's easier and less scary to simply trick oneself or to believe something is
true when, in fact, it is not.

Now this is all very high and abstract, but will manifest itself in very real ways.

Allow me to illustrate.

One might go to college to study something they have very little interest in, because
they fear what their parents might think if they admit to them and to themselves that
really what they would like to do is not accounting, but rather to work on a farm and
spend most of their time outdoors.

One might take a job at a company they dislike doing work they hate because it's
a scary thing to admit you've spent four years, or more, of
your life learning to do something you don't really even like.

One might marry a man or a woman whom they don't really get along with because
it's truly terrifying to tell that person that although you've spent several
years together and you've both invested a lot of time into each other,
you don't want to spend anymore time with them and would like
to find some one you think you might get along with better.

So in these situations it's acutely easier for a person to simply lie to themselves
than to face the cold hard and horrifying truth that perhaps they've been mistaken
and need to rethink and start over.

Lying takes a great deal of effort. When lying, one must continually remain alert and vigilant for
signs of the truth poking it's head out of the ground and must quickly cover it up and remember how and when they've done it. This is true for small lies and for big ones.
Often times people who carry these lies on for very long eventually slip up and
let the truth become uncovered, and whether they like it or not they must face the scary truth
grown it it's long time underground, even bigger and scarier that it was to begin with.

And so I say again. Do not lie, if you can help it, but absolutely do not lie to yourself.
Because no matter how you do it, you can't do it forever.


### A Question to consider for another time

Can one lie bravely? That is to say, can one know the truth, but force oneself
to double think it (viz. to know and not believe) so as to protect something
one loves or to protect something one considers to be noble.
