# Start Early, Start Often

When I was a young computer science student full of hopes and dreams, I took
several classes taught by a man who I regarded as a mentor. The first class I took
with him was Object Oriented Programming. What I liked so much about his classes
was his unconventional teaching style. He would come to class seemingly
totally unprepared and with only a dry-erase marker and (sometimes) his laptop.
He would walk into the classroom, sit on the table at the from of the room,
facing all his students, take a sip of coffee, sigh deeply in a way that spoke
volumes about his disposition, and ask, simply, "What do you guys want to learn today?"
In the event that no one spoke up, he just started talking about his research and
tried to tie it back into whatever the class was about.

I really appreciated that style, maybe I'm biased because I prefer to learn things
by listening to a lecture or dialog. But I think the real reason is that starting
things with only a broad goal in mind, and no firm plan for how to achieve that goal
is beneficial, in many ways over the alternative of making a well documented, step
by step plan for goal actualization.

The most important thing I learned from that professor, had nothing to do at all
with programming or software development and design. It was something he said as
a sort of motto after assigning each unconscionably large programming project.

"Start early, start often", sometimes he would modify it to "Start often, start over",
"Start early, start over", etc. But the spirit of the motto was always the same:
"You need to get going right now, the clock is ticking and who knows what's going
to happen or how long this is going to take you. Don't turn in your first attempt because
first attempts suck. You probably shouldn't feel even remotely confident
until you've restarted at least 2 maybe 3 times. Don't sink your whole ego into each
attempt, you'll never get anything done that way and you'll exhaust yourself."

This one little saying, these four innocuous words, have a lot of wisdom wrapped up
inside them. Maybe when my professor offered up this little gem, even he didn't realize
how much it meant, but it has resonated with me in the years since I first heard it, and
has come to mean a lot. Maybe I just keep tacking lessons onto this one saying, but it
seems to fit and that's enough for me.

You have just a very little bit of time to make the things you're going to make. You
can argue whether or not making things is a good use of a man's (life)time, but that's a
topic for another time. If you're trying to make things, you need to get started right
this very fucking minute. You can make plans you can draw patterns and do algebra and figure
costs and sketch foundations until you're out of time. But at some point you need to
make a leap and actually do the thing you've been planning. This isn't an argument against
planning, planning is to a certain extent necessary. But there is a time in every plan
when you ***feel*** that you're ready to start, ***but*** you don't feel confident, and you think
"maybe if I plan just a little more it'll go better". It is at this point that you need to jump in,
you need to put money on the table, viz. you need to commit.

And then when things start to tilt, and the plan begins to fall apart, you need to have the
patience, foresight and level-headedness to regroup, reformulate and retry. If you're code
is buggy as hell and you've lost track of what's happening where. If every change unleashes a
one hour slew of tweaking to make that change work, then it's time to start over, throw away the work
and keep the lessons learned from this attempt. Starting over is like waking up in the morning,
it's hard to do, but it feels hopeful. You have the chance to change the wrongs of the past.

Don't like the way your game draws everything to the screen? Know a better way? Re-write it!

Wish that you hadn't written your own stack class? Wish you'd known about the better more stable and
faster standard library stack? Use it in your re-write!

But what about all that work I just did? I can't just throw that away, my time is so important that
everything I make, no matter how non-functional, buggy or out right trashy it is, it intrinsically has
value and must be saved!

WRONG!

People make garbage all the time, just look at the all the landfills!

Does this mean I'm not great? My heroes never made trash. All their work is amazing.

Shut the fuck up! Your heroes weren't born amazing! And they certainly didn't make a masterpiece
every time they sat down to create. They made oodles and oodles of trash. Just like your trash.
And each time your heroes made a new piece of trash, it was slightly less trashy trash,
until everyone around them felt that their trash was not trash at all but that it was some
really good shit. But did your heroes suddenly stop thinking that their work was trash? No.
The fact is you'll never make anything that's perfect, but you can feel satisfied with
a certain piece of trash under a certain set of circumstances.

So you just need to ask yourself. Am I satisfied with this trash? No?

Start Over, Start Often!
