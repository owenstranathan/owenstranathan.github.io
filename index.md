My name is Owen and I'm a programmer.

I spend my time exploring my interests. I enjoy programming, making music, riding and repairing bicycles, writing in almost all forms, and game development.

I have a pet [dog](/assets/img/blue.JPG). Her name is Blue and she's a good dog.


This site exists to host my [CV](/assets/extra/owenstranathanCV.pdf),
a [blog](/archive),
as well as links to my [github](https://github.com/owenstranathan) and
[linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/owenstranathan) accounts. A lot of the code I write is on my
organization github account: [wabisoft](https://github.com/wabisoft).


Sometimes I freelance. If you want to work with me, you can email me at [owen@wabisoft.io](mailto:owen@wabisoft.io).
