My name is Owen. I'm a programmer and a freelance copywriter.

I spend my time exploring my interests such as programming, music, riding and repairing bicycles, writing in almost all forms, game development, personal fitness.

This site exists to host
my [blog](/archive) (which I don't add to very often),
as well as links to my [github](https://github.com/owenstranathan) and
[linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/owenstranathan) accounts. A lot of the code I write is on my
organization github account: [wabisoft](https://github.com/wabisoft).


I am availble for freelance software development and copywriting. If you would like to work with me, you can email me at [owen@wabisoft.io](mailto:owen@wabisoft.io).
