My name is Owen and I'm a programmer.

I spend my time exploring my interests. I enjoy programming, making music, riding and repairing bicycles, writing in almost all forms, and game development.

I have a pet [dog](/assets/img/blue.JPG). She's a good girl.


This site exists to host my [CV](/assets/extra/owenstranathanCV.pdf),
a [blog](/archive[) I don't use much,
as well as links to my [github](https://github.com/owenstranathan) and
[linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/owenstranathan)


Sometimes I freelance. If you want to work with me, you can email me at [owen@wabisoft.io](mailto:owen@wabisoft.io).
