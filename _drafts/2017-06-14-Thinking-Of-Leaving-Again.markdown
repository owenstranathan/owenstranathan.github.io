# It's about that time again

It's June 14th and I've been looking for a job for more than 3 weeks.
I've applied to countless companies and only heard back (beyond the automated
confirmation of receipt email that is ubiquitous) from one company, this morning
they rejected me. And so I'm faced with the familiar feeling of failure and the
dejected self pity that I know all to well. It's in these moments when I feel most
like running away.

# Running Away as a Solution

There are times in a person's life, when things seem so intractable and hopeless
that the only feasible option is to drop everything (and I mean everything) throw
everything not immediately needed and run to some distant land where everything,
if not actually, then at least for the time being will be better and simpler.

God knows that at this very moment I feel exactly this same way. And I should know,
running away has been my modus operandi for such a long time that I'm not really
sure how to stop.

Everyone gets these thoughts, or at least I've talked about this subject with a sufficiently
large sample of the general population that I feel confident extending the generalization
to everyone.

My recollection of the impulse from before I first acted on it is thus.

One experiences difficulties in daily life, one is emotionally exhausted by the
doldrums of life in an office. Or one suddenly becomes acutely aware of the
pointlessness of vying for success and acceptance by society. One tends through
no fault of one's own to become existentially anxious.

One starts to consider the purpose of their everyday actions, they analyze their
direction in life and begin to question the value of their previously self-apparently
valuable goals and wants.

One asks themselves many questions. Questions like:

* What am I doing here?
* How have I come to this point?
* What exactly do I want?
* What should I do with my life?
* Could I just go off into the woods?
