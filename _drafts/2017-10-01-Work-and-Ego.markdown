# Work

We all have to work. Some of us don't like it. Some of us have learned to love it.
And the rest of us are just kind of listlessly getting by without an opinion.
As a child one regards work as this nebulous activity executed by one's parents
on a ritualistically regular basis. One has no negative emotions toward the idea
of work unless one comes to have an experience that enforces a negative association
with work.

Such experiences could be something like:

* One's father missing an important game/recital/activity of any kind on account of "work"
* One's parents complaining that they are constantly doing "all the work".
* One being compelled to perform an unenjoyable chore or activity, for the benefit of another and that being referred to as "work".

In most instances, a given person, over the course of their development will come
to regard this thing we call "work" as something that *they*,
given the choice, most certainly don't want to do.

Like most accidents of development and societal evolution, this is really stupid and
really bad.

Let's take a moment and go back to our own minds before they were unintentionally shaped
into what they are today. Really think now, become the person you were before you
had to have a name for everything that popped into your head.

Do you remember? It's alright if you don't, it's really difficult to remember.

If you do you probably remember that you didn't do a damn thing you didn't want to,
and when something you didn't want to happen, that is to say, when something unexpected
happened as unexpected things are want to do, you did not have an immediate reaction
to them. You didn't have a quick categorization for this new experience to slip into
and be tucked away as a "good", "bad", "so-so", etc. experience. Some would have you believe
that at this moment you didn't have a "clear" picture of the world around you. They
would have you believe that you were ignorant or that you weren't yet capable of comprehending
things beyond a certain level. This is true to a certain extent. You weren't probably
capable of doing complex mathematics, or constructing particularly complicated thoughts,
and sentences, but just because you were inexperienced, and unpracticed doesn't mean
to say that you lacked the potential to do such things.


I don't know where I'm going with this.
