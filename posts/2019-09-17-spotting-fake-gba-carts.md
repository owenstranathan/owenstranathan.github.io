A few months back I bought an [Advanced Wars]() cartridge for my wicked sweet modded GameBoy Advanced on ebay,
but when I got it turned out to be a fake!
I was really ticked about it, so I made some PSA graphics to post in imgur and reddit.

I'm putting them up here as well, because I can and I want to.
