"Hello (person), my name is Owen Stranathan" is how I begin all emails to someone I don't know ;)

I am a writer, programmer, musician and world traveler. I only care about making
things that are beautiful. I work hard to create beautiful works in my respective fields of interest.
Whether I'm writing a piece of software, a composition, a song or
or seeking a new experience, I take a holistic approach.
I believe that the beauty is in the not knowing. The perfection is in the imperfect places.
[This is a better explanation of what I mean.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi)
I write on this site about my life and whatever I'm currently working on.

looking to hire a passionate creative who is <strong><em>not just</em></strong>
a programmer, then go check out my <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/{{site.linkedin}}"> <i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i> Linkedin</a> or drop
