    <p>I grew up in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootstown_Township,_Portage_County,_Ohio" >tiny little town</a> in Ohio</p>
    <p>When I was in highschool I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kitchen-Confidential-Updated-Adventures-Underbelly/dp/0060899220/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1496632464&sr=8-1&keywords=kitchen+confidential">a book</a>
        by Anthony Bourdain, that inspired me to learn to cook. For a time I wanted to be a Chef.</p>
    <p>
    <p>I spent my summers and after school hours in hot kitchens working and learning.</p>
    <p>I never became a Chef, but I still love to cook.</p>
    <p>I went to <a href="https://www.uakron.edu">The University of Akron</a> to study Computer Science.</p>
    <p>While I was there I met my <a href="http://shannashu.tumblr.com">beautiful wife</a>, who is a <a href="https://www.behance.net/susannashu6573">crazy talented designer</a></p>
    <p>I got along well with <a href="https://github.com/asutton">one specific professor</a> who got me interested in <a href="https://github.com/owenstranathan/banjo"> Language Design.</a></p>
    <p>More recently I've been getting interested in UXD and (forever and ever) Game Design</p>
    <p>I graduated in May 2016 with a B.S. in Computer Science and a 3.4 GPA</p>
    <p>I am currently looking for a full time position as a <strong>Software Developer</strong></p>
    <p>Check out the blog (I don't post often, but when I do I try to write something good) or click on one of the icons at the bottom of the page to visit me on github, linkedin, facebook, steam, etc.</p.
