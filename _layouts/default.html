                        <p>
                        <a href="https://github.com/wabisoft/one-million-ants">one-million-ants (Work in progress)</a>:
                        A game about ants, gravity, and rocket ships. Don't let the ants touch your base!
                        </p>

                        <p><a href="https://github.com/owenstranathan/bash-templater">bash-templater</a>:
                        Needed a template engine, needed it to not need other software to run. Started as
                        a fork, then mostly rewrote/extended greatly</p>

                        <p><a href="https://github.com/owenstranathan/bashtest">bashtest</a>:
                        Needed a test runner in bash to run tests on bash-templater. 
                        Made it general enough to use elsewhere.</p>
 
                        <p><a href="https://github.com/owenstranathan/supertramp">supertramp</a>:
                        The skeleton of a CI/CD build/deploy service very closely modeled on the one built
                        for appfigures. Uses docker in docker, kubectl and... you guessed it MAKE! who needs yaml? Not this guy</p>
