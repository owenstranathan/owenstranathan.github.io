My site is pretty dang ugly isn't it? I mean where's the styles? Wheres the outlines and the shadows and the parallax!?
It's not here. I don't need it. You don't need it. I'm just writing words here, and because I'm not selling anything the only
thing that is important is the content, I don't get anything if people read my blog, I don't loose anything if they don't so it's not valuable
for me to throw a bunch of unnecessary styling on this webpage because it really an truly doesn't matter.
