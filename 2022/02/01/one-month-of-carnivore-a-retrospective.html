            <div class="post-content">
                    <p>As I may have mentioned in earlier posts; this January I did the carnivore diet for the whole month.  I want to
take a moment to reflect on the diet and its results.  The month of carnivore did exactly what I knew it would do. I
lost 20 lbs. half of that probably being water weight and I felt clear and clean for much of the month. I've done this
diet in the past and there are many aspects of it that I like, some that I don't like and some that I both like and
dislike. Here I will list just a few.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Clear headedness/stable energy levels</strong> - When you eat a carnivore diet you are also eating a semi-ketogenic diet
   in that you have completely eliminated carbs. So after you acclimate to the change in energy source (ketones over
glycogen) a nice benefit is that you have a clean stable energy level that doesn't spike or drop throughout the day and
your mind is less distracted and flitting and more directed (unless you go drink a bunch of caffeine which I did most
days to help me tackle my morning runs).</li>
<li><strong>A general disinterest in or apathy toward food</strong> - This is caused by 2 things I think. The first cause is the same
   as above, you're in ketosis and so your body isn't really ever without energy because it can just tap into body fat
whenever it needs. The only time you feel hunger is when your stomach is empty and your vagus nerve starts complaining.
The form of hunger more common in a diet featuring carbs is hormonal hunger caused as a reaction to drops in blood
sugar. This kind of hunger is what makes you fantasize about lunch at 10:30 and it doesn't really happen all that often
on a ketogenic diet because your blood sugar levels stay pretty even. The second reason is because when you only eat
meat your meals become pretty monotonous. If you don't feel hungry the prospect of eating more meat is not very
exciting. The brain doesn't crave more fat or protein when it's satisfied because fat alone doesn't trigger an outsized
dopamine response. It's sugar that gives you that drug-like hit of dopamine that keeps you reaching for the snacks even
though you're quite full. I both like and dislike this aspect of the diet because while it simplifies my interaction
with food it also shortens and de-emphasises them which can negatively impact social interactions, particularly with my
wife who deeply loves eating and meal times.</li>
<li><strong>A decrease in stamina</strong> - Again related the fact that a carnivore diet relies on ketones and not glycogen. So long
   as you're exerting yourself at a low intensity (aerobically) you can go for a long time because you have all the
energy you need in the form of body fat. But if you want to work just a little harder or a lot harder (anaerobically)
then you don't have a lot of gas and you get tired quickly and need more rest than normal. This negatively impacts work
outs, specifically strength training and high intensity cardio sessions like sprints or fast runs. You can overcome this
problem while remaining carnivore with things like milk and honey (though some purists may argue the use of dairy, my
thinking is if it comes from a cow then it's carnivore) to give you carbs before and after a hard workout. The only
problem being that you will fall out of ketosis and thus experience the unpleasantness of re-entering once the sugar
runs out. Viz.  you will feel hormonal hunger and all that comes with it to varying degrees (irritability, headaches,
etc). I didn't not indulge in honey and only used milk very sparingly this month simply because I wanted to maximize my
fat loss and so did not want to exit ketosis if I could help it. This little problem is the main reason I won't continue
carnivore as it's pretty limiting to me in terms of workouts. That and I miss fruit and vegetables.</li>
<li><strong>Carnivore isn't really keto</strong> - I know this contradicts what I said earlier but not really. I said that carnivore
   is semi-ketogenic, and so it is. It could be fully ketogenic if you are so inclined but a true keto diet is very
difficult to sustain. A true keto diet is any diet that keeps your body in ketosis (generating and using ketones for
energy instead of glycogen). To do this on carnivore, particularly if you are a pretty lean person, could be difficult
since you may not have a lot of extra body fat to tap in to so you may need to eat <strong>lots and lots</strong> of external fat to
keep your keto engine humming. This is easy if all you eat is 80/20 ground beef and grain finished ribeye, but that's
not a good idea for reasons outside the scope of this post. So you may find yourself do things like drinking butter,
heavy cream, beef tallow or bacon grease to get the requisite fat to stay keto. This can be unpleasant and difficult to
measure.</li>
<li><strong>Great digestion</strong> - If you start carnivore today and keep going for a couple days you'll think I'm a liar on day 2
   when you have your first bout with the diarrhea and or constipation that comes with transitioning to a high fat zero
carb diet. But after the first week or so your body acclimates and your bowels become a total non issue. I mean as low
maintenance as you can get. Occasional (every other day maybe) firm healthy movements with no gas. Gas in particular is
an issue for me and on carnivore I'm virtually fartless.</li>
<li><strong>Hugely simplified grocery shopping</strong> - Most grocery stores in the US are laid out the same. You enter into the
   produce section one side of the building, the butcher and deli are in the back on the periphery. The center is a sea
of dry goods and processed foods. The dairy and beverages are on the opposite side of the building from the produce. The
bakery is usually in the back on the same side as the produce. I don't know why they're all so similar but when you eat
carnivore and you go to the store you can skip 90% of it and go to the butcher, then the dairy and then leave. Or if you
live a place with strong local food business you can skip the store entirely and buy your meat from the local butcher
shop. Or if you're in a rural setting like me you can do what I did for much of the month and buy your meat, milk and
eggs directly from a local farm. And get your more processed items like bacon from the butcher.</li>
<li><strong>A less wasteful plate</strong> - When you eat carnivore you may start out being a bit spoiled and eating only the choice
   cuts you know you like. But you can't survive on chicken tenders and soon enough you'll start feeling crappy. It's
amazing how nourishing the nasty bits on an animal can be. When you start to feel weak and tired and let's face it a
little starved from just eating lean muscle and fat all the time. Have a slice of liver fried in butter, or a chunk of
braised heart. You'll instantly feel more alive, and it'll probably taste better to you than it ever has before. Even if
you "Don't like" the offal. Give it another try on carnivore when your body is starved the nutrients it used to get from
fortified processed foods. When you need it your brain will make it taste good. This translates to a less wasteful use
of the animal because you end up eating <strong>all</strong> of it. Even the bones. This is definitely a good thing.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are probably more aspects of interest regarding a carnivore diet but I think I've enumerated enough for now.
All in all I think carnivore is a great short term diet to educate you about how your body processes food, the
difference between what it needs and what it wants and the food system that supports you in your everyday life.
I'm not convinced it can be followed long term for optimal health but there are definitely proponents with a lot more
data, research and experience than me who believe that you can. Specifically Paul Saladino author of the carnivore code
presents a emphatic argument <strong>for</strong> long term carnivore eating. I've also heard of famous internet personalities with
auto-immune disorders and problems having good outcomes with carnivore. Assessing those claims is outside my ability and
interest as I have no auto-immune disorders and I don't care that much about those famous people.</p>
<p>I like to eat carnivore periodically and for health and educational benefits. Perhaps you might like to try it, I
encourage you to do so. If you do, try to source your meat responsibly. That to me means a few things in a specific
order from most important to least important:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Humanely raised</strong> - Factory farming is evil and wrong. This one is a tough one. The <strong>best</strong> way to ensure your
   food is humanely raised is to have a relationship to the food before it's slaughtered. i.e. knowing where and how the
animals are raised and cared for by developing a relationship with the farmer. But that's not a viable option for many
people. The second best way is to do some research and find a certifying body that you feel you can trust to adequately
certify that a given food is humanely cared for and then only shop their label. I will say that if I can't get eggs from
the farmer or bacon from the butcher I will buy from the grocery in which case I look for the "Certified Humane" label
on eggs and meat. But you should do your own research and figure something out that works for you. Those humane
certifications usually come with an increase in price, a powerful statement on the sick state of our society that basic
decency can be had but only at a premium and the default is evil and cruelty. If you really cannot afford to get humane
meat then you must make a choice for yourself based on what your priorities are and consider all the options. Is eating
highly processed soy and cereal grains grown in devastating large scale mono crop agricultures better than factory
farming? I don't think so, but that doesn't make factory farming ok, both are wrong but in different ways.  You must
decide what you can live with and what you cannot. Perhaps you might buy more expensive food and eat less?  Maybe such
an alteration will change your outlook and drive you to have a more direct relationship with the source and production
of the food that sustains you.</li>
<li><strong>Local</strong> - I'm talking like in the same town or county. Getting locally raised meat is important as it contributes
   directly to farmers in your area and allows you have a more direct relationship with the life and death of your food.</li>
<li><strong>Grass fed/finished</strong> - Grain fed animals have less nutritious meat and more fat. You are what you eat after all and
   if your cow or lamb only eats corn then its meat will be less nutritious than one that eats pasture legume grasses
it's whole life. <strong>Dont be fooled</strong> by labels at the grocery that just say "Grass fed", with beef at least this is
misleading because almost all beef is grass fed on pasture for the first part of it's life. The difference comes when
the cow is approaching it's slaughter weight how it's "finished". A grass finished beef's diet is not changed and the
farmer continues to feed the cow grass. A grain finished beef is fed grains (usually corn in the US) to fatten it up and
make nice decadent fat-marbled steaks and roasts. This comes at the opportunity cost of all the nutrients the animal
would have gotten from the grass, nutrients only the beef and other ruminants can unlock for us since we lack a rumen to
digest the grass.</li>
<li><strong>Organic</strong> - A last ditch effort to get high quality humanely raised nutritious meat is to just look for the organic
   label. Yes it's more expensive and while the USDA, despite being bureaucratic authoritarians, make no guarantees
about the quality of life offered to an organically raised animal; chances are good that if the farmer is foregoing
easier methods of farming to raise organic meat then they might also be inclined to simply care for their animals more.
If only because not doing so will make it harder for them down the road without hormones and antibiotics at their
infinite disposal.</li>
<li><strong>Skip it</strong> - I talk a lot about beef because it's the main animal I eat. But there are a lot of animals you can eat.
   It doesn't have to be beef. If you can't find grass finished organic humanely raised beef in your area at a price you
can afford then look for something else. Maybe you can afford humanely raised organic eggs. You can go a long way just
eating eggs and dairy. Be creative and don't limit yourself. Look for less conventional meats like rabbit, mutton or
goat. Find a solution that works for you in your area. If the thing you thought you could get turns out to not be viable
you can always just skip it and look for something else or eat a more limited diet. Chances are if your reading this
then you're not starving and could stand to have a little self imposed limitation to your diet.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think now that I've rambled long enough so I better wrap this up.
Today is the first day of February and so my month of carnivore is over, but it's brought me closer to my food and made
me a slightly more thoughtful and appreciative eater of plants and animals. I hope my experience has been valuable to
you, it certain was to me.</p>

        My blog exists as a place for me to (as frictionlessly as possible) write often and without concern for the
        reception. Like a public journal with more drawn out and philosophical entries and topics. That said I don't always have
        the time or inclination to proof read each post as thoroughly as I might if I were publishing my writing on paper.
        Without doubt I will have made some spelling and grammar mistakes. I maybe even said one or two things that just plain
        don't make sense. I hope you'll understand and not judge to harshly. It's true that good writing is good editing,
        however my aim in this blog is quantity and consistency and not quality. Any good writing found here is entirely
        incidental and should be excused.
